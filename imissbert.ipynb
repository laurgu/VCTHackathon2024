A rope ascender is available to take players from A Site to A Top. When players go down from A Top to A Drop their fall is silenced, provided they do not run and land too far off the drop.\\n\\nA unique feature to Lotus is its rotating doorways. It has one on A Side standing between A Main and A Tree, and another on C Side standing between C Mound and B Main. The doors can be activated from either side using a toggle button, at which point the door will rotate 180° over 10 seconds, giving players a small window where they can pass through to the other side.\\n\\nA destructible wall also stands between A Main and A Link. Whilst intact, it absorbs damage and cannot be penetrated by gunfire. The wall however has 400 HP and can be damaged, with colored indicators on it implying how much health it has left (starts blue, then turns yellow and then red as it takes more damage). It can eventually be destroyed to allow players to pass through a passageway between A Main and A Link for the rest of the round.\\n\\n\\n{{Map:Lotus}}\\n\\n\\n<div style=\"overflow:auto; max-height:1000px\">\\n<center>\\n<div style=display:inline-table>\\n{: class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\\n!class=unsortable: Image\\n!Name\\n!Source\\n[[File:Astral Conduit Card Large.png: 50px]]\\n!class=unsortable: Image\\n!Name\\n!Source\\n[[File:Name Buddy.png: 75px]]', 'trivia': '', 'location': '{{fi|IN}} Western Ghats, Karnataka, India, Omega Earth', 'elements': 'Rope ascender<br>400 HP destructible wall<br>Rotating doorways<br>Silent drop', 'sites': 'A/B/C', 'added': 'January 10th, 2023<br><small>([[Episode 06: REVELATION: Act 1|EP 06 Act 1]], {{patchv|6.0}})</small>', 'codename': 'Jam', 'rotation': 'Enabled', 'teleporters': '', 'coordinates': '14°07\\'AD.4\"N8 74°53\\'XY\"E8<br>(14°07\\'03\"N 74°53\\'21\"E)', 'feature': ''}, {'Map': 'Lotus', 'Games Played': 20, 'ATK WIN': '55%', 'DEF WIN': '45%', 'omen': '100%', 'sova': '0%', 'viper': '68%', 'cypher': '18%', 'raze': '75%', 'fade': '90%', 'killjoy': '53%', 'jett': '8%', 'gekko': '5%', 'breach': '33%', 'neon': '20%', 'kayo': '3%', 'brimstone': '0%', 'astra': '3%', 'yoru': '0%', 'skye': '3%', 'harbor': '0%', 'deadlock': '3%', 'sage': '0%', 'clove': '15%', 'chamber': '8%', 'iso': '0%', 'phoenix': '0%', 'reyna': '0%', 'vyse': '0%'}]\n"]}],"source":["results = search(client, 'documents_index', 'lotus')\n","print(results)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":65,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["[{'biography': '', 'trivia': '', 'tournament results': '', 'id': 'TenZ', 'is_retired': 'No', 'name': 'Tyson Ngo', 'pronoun': 'He', 'country': 'Canada', 'residency': 'North America', 'birth_date_year': '2001', 'role': 'Player', 'stream': 'https://www.twitch.tv/tenz', 'facebook': '', 'twitter': 'TenZOfficial', 'instagram': 'tenzofficial', 'youtube': 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCckPYr9b_iVucz8ID1Q67sw', 'native_name': ''}, {'Rnd': 578, 'R2.0': 1.1, 'ACS': 210.0, 'K:D': 1.08, 'KAST': '75%', 'ADR': 136.8, 'KPR': 0.74, 'APR': 0.41, 'FKPR': 0.08, 'FDPR': 0.1, 'HS%': '25%', 'CL%': '6%', 'CL': '3/51', 'KMax': 29, 'K': 426, 'D': 395, 'A': 238, 'FK': 47, 'FD': 56, 'Player': 'TenZ', 'Agents': ['omen', 'gekko', 'kayo'], 'Roles': ['initiator', 'controller']}]\n"]}],"source":["result2 = search(client, 'documents_index', 'tenz')\n","print(result2)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":66,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":706,"status":"ok","timestamp":1726805712049,"user":{"displayName":"Lauren Gu","userId":"04218102845059789362"},"user_tz":240},"id":"UMvmGCNEd4dV","outputId":"a3c3e795-608b-44c4-d95f-8890890fdc8b"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Assistant: Based on TenZ's recent stats, he's been playing **Omen, Gekko, and Kayo** on Bind.
